# Solution Design Document

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the design decisions, architecture choices, and trade-offs made in implementing the Fintech Payments System. The solution demonstrates a production-ready microservices architecture with emphasis on resilience, observability, and maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Microservices Architecture

**Decision**: Implemented as two separate microservices rather than a monolith.

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ledger management and transfer processing have distinct responsibilities
- **Independent Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently based on load patterns
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can evolve with different technology stacks if needed
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't directly impact the other

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Better scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Increased complexity, network latency, distributed system challenges

### Service Boundaries

#### Ledger Service (Port 8080)
**Responsibilities**:
- Account balance management
- Transaction record keeping
- Data persistence
- Account lifecycle management

**Design Decisions**:
- **Java 21**: Latest LTS version for better performance and features
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Modern framework with native compilation support
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Mature ORM for complex data relationships
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance for financial data integrity

#### Transfer Service (Port 8081)
**Responsibilities**:
- Payment transfer orchestration
- Business logic validation
- External service integration
- Resilience patterns implementation

**Design Decisions**:
- **Java 21**: Stable LTS version with broad ecosystem support
- **Resilience4j**: Circuit breaker and retry patterns
- **WebClient**: Non-blocking HTTP client for service communication
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format for better observability

## üîÑ Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
**Choice**: HTTP/REST for service-to-service communication

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement, test, and debug
- **Immediate Consistency**: Real-time validation of transfers
- **Standard Protocols**: Wide tooling and monitoring support

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple, immediate feedback, easy debugging
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Tight coupling, potential cascading failures, latency sensitivity

### Alternative Considered: Event-Driven Architecture
**Why Not Chosen**:
- Added complexity for the current scope
- Eventual consistency challenges for financial operations
- Additional infrastructure requirements (message brokers)

**Future Consideration**: Could be implemented for audit trails and notifications

## üõ°Ô∏è Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Implementation**: Resilience4j circuit breaker in Transfer Service

**Configuration**:
```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      ledgerService:
        failure-rate-threshold: 50
        wait-duration-in-open-state: 30s
        sliding-window-size: 10
        minimum-number-of-calls: 5
```

**Rationale**:
- **Fail Fast**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Service Protection**: Protects downstream services from overload
- **Graceful Degradation**: Allows system to continue operating with reduced functionality

### Retry Pattern
**Implementation**: Exponential backoff with jitter

**Configuration**:
```yaml
resilience4j:
  retry:
    instances:
      ledgerService:
        max-attempts: 3
        wait-duration: 1s
        exponential-backoff-multiplier: 2
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Handles transient failures, improves success rates
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Increased latency, potential for amplifying load

### Rate Limiting
**Implementation**: Token bucket algorithm

**Rationale**:
- **Resource Protection**: Prevents service overload

## üíæ Data Management

### Database Choice: PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical for financial transactions
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Extensive tooling and community support
- **Performance**: Excellent performance for OLTP workloads
- **JSON Support**: Flexible schema evolution capabilities

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Reliability, consistency, feature-rich
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Vertical scaling limitations, operational complexity

### Data Consistency Strategy
**Approach**: Strong consistency within service boundaries

**Design Decisions**:
- **Single Database per Service**: Data ownership and autonomy
- **Transactional Boundaries**: ACID transactions within services
- **Eventual Consistency**: Between services (future consideration)

### Caching Strategy
**Implementation**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Reduced database load and improved response times
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of read operations
- **Session Management**: Distributed session storage

## üîç Observability & Monitoring

### Logging Strategy
**Approach**: Structured logging with JSON format

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2025-01-16T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger_name": "za.co.titandynamix.service.TransferService",
  "message": "Transfer completed successfully",
  "transfer_id": "12345",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "from_account": "ACC001",
  "to_account": "ACC002"
}
```
